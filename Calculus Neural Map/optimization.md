The most important part of optimization is knowing whether you are looking for the min or max. For example, trying to find the least amount of material used would mean looking for the min, while finding the max angle would mean looking for a max. 

The first step identify equations that relate what values you are given and what you are trying to find. This may be in the form of either a mathematical formula or deduction from the scenario given. 

If there is more than one equation, then the next step is to perform a subsitution to combine the two equations into one, and solve for the second variable at the end.
