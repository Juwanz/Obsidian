rectilinear motion is any calculus involving physical movement. In rectilinear motion, everything is a function of time. 
$x(t)$ defines the <u>displacement</u> of an object
$|x(t)|$ defines the <u>distance traveled</u> by an object
$v(t)$ is equal to $x'(t)$ and defines the velocity of an object
$a(t)$ is equal to $v'(t)$ and $x''(t)$ and defines the velocity of an object

The [[fundamental theorem of calculus]], and the properties of [[Derivative]]s and [[integral]]s may be used to analyze and evaluate rectilinear motion.
