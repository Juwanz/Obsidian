The parametric coordinate system differs from Cartesian coordinates in that Parametric in that parametric separates the x and y as a function of t. This allows for unique function shapes and also allows for you to see the path that the function takes when it is graphed. This means that parametric functions can look the same but have totally different equations. 
###### [[Derivative]]
$\frac{dy}{dx}$ takes the form of $\frac{dy/dt}{dx/dt}$. Horizontal tangents exist when $\frac{dy}{dt}=0$ and $\frac{dx}{dt}\neq0$. Vertical  tangents exist when $\frac{dx}{dt}=0$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}\neq0$. If both $\frac{dx}{dt}$ and $\frac{dy}{dt}\neq0$, there may be a cusp or something like that. 
The second derivative $\frac{dy^2}{d^2x}=\frac{\frac{d}{dt}\frac{dy}{dx}}{\frac{dx}{dt}}$ . 
###### [[Integral]] Applications
the arc length of a graph in parametric takes the form of $\int_{a}^{b}\sqrt{d^2x+d^2y}dt$ .
to find the area, simply multiply the arc length equation by $2\pi r$ to get $2\pi \int_{a}^{b}r\sqrt{d^2x+d^2y}dt$ , where r is the radius of the "circle".
to find volume, the equation is $\int_{a}^{b}\sqrt{g(t)f'(t)}dt$, where $g(t)$ and $f(t)$ are either $y$ or $x$, interchangeably.
