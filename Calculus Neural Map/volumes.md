volumes may be defined as the rotation of a function along a line of rotation, be that the x-axis, y-axis, or a line denoted by $x=a$ or $y=a$. There are two main ways to figure out the volume of a rotation: the [[#cylindrical shell method]] or the [[#washer method]]

### washer method 
The washer method is when you take a sum of multiple cylinders or washers normal to the line of rotation. As their heights get infinitately small, the sum of the volumes will equate the volume of the rotation. When rotating about the x-axis or a parallel axis, the height would be in the x direction and the radius would equal $f(x)$, which is normal to the line of rotation.

Thus, the equation for a volume of revolution along the x-axis is:
	$\pi\int_{a}^{b} f^2(x)dx$ 
The equation for a volume of revolution along the y-axis is:
	$\pi\int_{a}^{b} x^2f'(x)dx$  

### cylindrical shell method 
The cylindrical shell method works by revolving shells around. Whereas the washer method adds the area of cylinders normal to the axis of revolution, the cylindrical shell method works by adding up shells of varying radii along the axis of revolution. 

The formula for the cylindrical shell method is 
	$2\pi\int_{a}^{b}xf(x)dx$
