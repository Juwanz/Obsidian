Conics are parabolas, ellipses, and hyperbolas. 

###### Parabolas
Parabolas take the form of $y^2=4px$ or $x^2=4py$. In this form, the directrix of the parabola will be either $x=-p$ or $y=-p$ while the focus of the graph takes the form of $(0,p)$ or $(p,0)$. The x or y value for the vertex of the graph lies in the center of the x or y value for the focus and directrix. 
It is important to note that the focus, vertex, and directrix of a graph may be shifted. In these cases, the equation will take the form of $(y-a)^2=4p(x-b)$. In this case. The center of the graph will be shifted from $(0,0)$ to $(b,a)$. The focus now takes the form of $(b+p, a)$ while the directrix now takes the form of $x=b+p$. 

###### Ellipses
Ellipses take the form of $\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$. The long direction of the graph will be determined by the biggest value between $a^2$ and $b^2$, where the foci and vertices will lay along the long side. 
For an ellipse, foci take the form of $\pm c$, where $c^2 = a^2-b^2$. Vertices take the form of either $a^2$ or $b^2$, whichever one is greater. 

###### Hyperbolas
Hyperbolas take the form of $\frac{x^2}{a^2}-\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$ or $\frac{y^2}{a^2}-\frac{x^2}{b^2}=1$. Whichever part of the function, x or y is positive determines upon which axis the graph will open up towards. Vertices remain determined by $\pm a$ and foci by $\pm c$, but for a hyperbola, $c^2=a^2+b^2$. Asymptotes are $y=\pm \frac{y}{x}$, where y and x are the a and b values the are the denominators for $x^2$ and $y^2$. 

###### Conics in [[Polar Coordinates]]
In polar, conics take the form of $\frac{ed}{1\pm ecos\theta}$ or $\frac{ed}{1\pm esin\theta}$, where d is the distance from focus to directrix and e is the eccentricity of the graph. 
Parabolas have eccentricity of 1
Ellipses have an eccentricity less than 1
Hyperbolas have an eccentricity greater than 1

$\pm sin\theta or cos\theta$ determines in which direction the conic opens. $cos\theta$ means that the conics opens left to right while $sin\theta$ means that the conic opens up and down. 
A negative coefficient means that the center(of ellipse or hyperbola) is below the focus(origin of graph) while a positive coefficient means that it is above the focus. 
For parabolas, this means that negative => opens upwards while positive => opens downwards
