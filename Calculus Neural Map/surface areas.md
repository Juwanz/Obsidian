surface area works off the principle of revolving the arc length of a function along a range around a radius. 
The formula for arc length goes as follows: 
	$\int_{a}^{b} \sqrt{1+f'^2(x)}dx$. 
This is the same for both surface areas of revolutions along the x and y axes. 
Thus, the fromula for the surface area around the x-axis is:
	$2\pi\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\sqrt{1+f'^2(x)}dx$ 
The equation for the surface area of revolutions around the y axis is:
	$2\pi\int_{a}^{b}x\sqrt{1+f'^2(x)}dx$.
