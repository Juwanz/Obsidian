Linear approximation is a way to approximate the value of a function close to point a.
the formula goes as follows:
	$f(num-around-a) \approx f(a)+f'(a)(x-a)$  
This also the formula for a tangent line at point $a$ of a function. 

Linear approximations may be used to find the value of $f(n)$ if $n$ is close to $a$. However, as this is a linear approximation, logic must be used to determine whether or not said approximation will be accurate or not by analyzing the shape of the graph.
