$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ defines what $f(x)$ will approach as x approaches a from both sides

$\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ only exists if both $\lim_{x\to a^-} f(x)$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+} f(x)$ exist and are equal to each other

however, $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ may sometimes not and does not have to equal the true value of f(x)

if $\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ = $\frac{a}{0}$ where a is a real number, there is an verticle asymtote at that point, or the limit there does not exist. 

a [[Derivative]] defines the slope of a graph at any point x on the graph and may be expressed as $\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$  or $\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)-f(a)}{f-a}$.  

when $\lim_{x\to a} f(x)$ approaches $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$, [[L'Hopitals rule]] may be used to solve the limit.
