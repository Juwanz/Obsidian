graphs may be graphed better using some basical calculus principles. 

## critical points
critical points are points along the graph where $f'(x) = 0$ or undefined. At these points, the graph is at either a local max or a local min.   

## local min and max
local min and maxes may be found using [[critical points]]. 
The first or second derivative tests may be used to find if they are a min or a max
### first derivative test
if $f'(x)=0$ or undefined and $\lim_{x\to a^-} f'(x)< 0$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+} f'(x)>0$, then x is a local minmum.
likewise, if $f'(x)=0$ and $\lim_{x\to a^-} f'(x)>0$ and $\lim_{x\to a^+}f'(x)<0$, then x is a local maximum.
if they are both positive or negative, then x may be a shelf point, is not a local min or max
### second derivative test
the second derivative defines the concavity of a function at any point. If $f''(a)<0$, then f(x) is concave down at point a. If $f''(x)>0$, then f(x) is concave up at point a.

If $f(x)$ has a critical point at a and $f''(a)<0$, meaning that $f''(x)$ is concave down at point a, then a is a local max.
If $f(x)$ has a critcal point at a and $f''(x)>0$, meaning that $f''(x)$ is concave down at up at point a, then a is a local min.
