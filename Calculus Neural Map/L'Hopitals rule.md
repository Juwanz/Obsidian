L'Hopital's rule is a way of finding a limit when it initially approaches $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. 

L'Hopital's rule:  if $\lim_{x\to a} f(x) = \frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$ ,
$\lim_{x\to a} \frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \lim_{x\to a} \frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}$ 

functions may be manipulated to conform to L'Hopital's rule by manipulating the fraction have an initial limit equal to $\frac{0}{0}$ or $\frac{\infty}{\infty}$. Taking both sides to the power of $e$ may also help with simplifying the expression into managable terms. If done, the answer will take the form of $e^a$.
